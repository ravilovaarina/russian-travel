# Project: Russian travel
'Travel in Russia' is a one-page site about domestic tourism. It was created to tell Russian citizens that traveling in Russia can also be enjoyable and interesting.
Compared with the previous project work 'how to learn', this site was created using adaptive layout, using flexbox, grid-layout and media requests.
